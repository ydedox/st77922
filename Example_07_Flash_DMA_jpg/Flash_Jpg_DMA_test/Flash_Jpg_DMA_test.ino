// Example for library:
// https://github.com/Bodmer/TJpg_Decoder

//This example renders a Jpeg file that is stored in an array within Flash (program) memory
//see image.h file.  The image file being ~13Kbytes.

//pin usage as follow:
//                   CS  DC/RS  RESET    SDI/MOSI  SCK   SDO/MISO  BL      VCC    GND
